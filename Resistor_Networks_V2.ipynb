      "I've found that nearly all functions I build work on the same data: the conductivity matrix and external voltage.  As such, the number of functions and how they work together is becoming overly complex and I would like to work on implementing these ideas in a class rather than the current wide array of functions.  In order to keep things inexpensive in memory, I would like to use sparse matrices throughout and while I will probably equip many solvers, I would like to put some effort into getting a conjugate gradient solution to run as I think it will be useful for memristor networks.
