      "I've found that nearly all functions I build work on the same data: the conductivity matrix and external voltage.  As such, the number of functions and how they work together is becoming overly complex and I would like to work on implementing these ideas in a class rather than the current wide array of functions.  In order to keep things inexpensive in memory, I would like to use sparse matrices throughout and while I will probably equip many solvers, I would like to put some effort into getting a conjugate gradient solution to run as I think it will be useful for memristor networks.

As such, I would prefer to specify voltages.  The equations above give us $N$ unknowns and $M$ boundary conditions to specify where the unknowns are our node voltages and the boundary conditions are our external currents.\n",

The remaining nodes give a system of $N-M$ equations in $N-M$ unknowns whose matrix is both symmetric (as the conductance between two nodes is symmetric) and postive definite (as opposed to semidefinite for the laplacian. By removing rows and columns we have removed the solutions $L\\cdot(1, 1, 1,....1) = 0$.  This means it is a natural candidate for a conjugate gradient solution!"
