      "Perhaps the simplest interesting problem related to resistor network is that of the infinite grid.  The problem is simply to calculate the resistance between two point on some regular lattice of resistors.  The simplest example, that of the 2D cubic lattice with points joined by a single edge can be solved through symmetry.\n",
      "\n",
      "Consider a unit current fed into a node on an infinite lattice of resistors.  Symmetry dictates that the current must flow equally along each of the four edges leaving the node.  Similarly, if a unit current is drawn from the lattice, a current of $\\frac{I}{4}$ must flow through each branch.  Taking advantage of superposition, we place these the source and sink on adjacent nodes.  Now, by superposition, half of the current flows along the single bond and the rest flows through the lattice, so their resistances must be equal.  Thus the resistance between to adjacent points is $2 \\Omega$.\n",

      "It has been found that the distribution of voltages across each resistor displays multi-fractal scaling meaning that the different moments of the distribution scale independently.  More 'typical' distribution display simpler behavior in their moments.  for example, the even moments of the maxwell distribution are all proportional to $\\left<(v^2)^n\\right> \\propto (v_{th}^2)^{p(n)}$ where $p(n)$ is some linear function of $n$.  In this case, the single velocity scale $v_{th}$ dominates all moments.  (This is not so surprising as in the max-ent definition the Gaussian is a distribution that exhibits a single scale.)  In multi-fractal scaling, a wide range of scales is present in the distribution and this is evidenced by some nonlinear relationship in $p(n)$.\n",
