      "Given a network of resistors with a set of nodes held at some external voltages, I would like to create a group of functions that will solve for the voltages across the network.  We can characterize the network as a set of $N$ nodes, the resistances between them $\\{R_{ij}\\}$ and a set of external voltages $\\{V_{ext,i}\\}$ applied to some set of nodes. How I wish to represent them in python will depend on how I wish to solve them and that in turn will depend on whatever formalism I come up with for solving them.  So let's get started with that:"
