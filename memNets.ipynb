      "Chialvo contends that our neural dynamics exhibit properties that can be understood in terms of criticality in the statistical physics sense. He first states that neuroscientists have lost site of the global issues of flexibility and emergent order in their modelling.  Current models are all either 1) low dimensional 2) specialized or 3) if they are not specialized they require external influence to shift behaviors. Chialvo's case for the brain exhibiting criticality follows:\n",
      "\n",
      "* As the brain contains the *necessary* (but not sufficient) conditions to display complex emergent behavior (large number of interating nonlinear elements) it must be capable of displaying critical behavior\n",
      "* Healthy brains do not, on average, have a prefered temporal scale in electrical (EEG/MEG) readings\n",
      "* All models that display emergent complex behavior also display criticality.  The large number of accessible metastable states at a critical point may explain the brains flexibility\n",
      "* Neuronal avalanches have a scale free size distribution matching a critical branching process and alternative explanations to criticality have not emerged.  These were observed during early development which implies the precence of a neuromodulator that may act as a order parameter.\n",
      "* MEG recordings have observed large scale shifts in recordings as a behavioral parameter is varied supporting the idea that the brain is a pattern forming system that shifts between coherent states\n",
      "* Degree distributions created from fMRI recordings are scale-free and closely resemble those made from an Ising model at it's critical point\n",
      "\n",
      "####Thoughts\n",
      "The idea of the brain being in a critical state is interesting but the main difficulty I have with it is that criticality is defined so loosely that almost anything can fit.  In physics we should have: as an order parameter is varied, the correlation length in space and time diverge and we get dynamics in which there are many accessible metastable states and the system is very sensitive to perturbations such that they will take the system between these metastable states."

      "Networks of atomic switches may provide a working model of Turing's \"B-Type unorganized machine\" originally posed as randomly interconnected network of NAND gates.  These devices may be attractive as their architecture is scalable and may bypass the 'von Neumann Bottleneck' (vNB).  Until now the difficulty of fabrication has limited their realization but solution phase electrochemistry offers an approach to constructing complex metallic networks through DLA. This process spontaneously forms nanogaps and crossbar-like junctions that may act as inorganic synapses.  They were able to form an electronic device of silver MIM junctions and crossbar-like interfaces. To form the network, an initial sustained high bias was applied until a large temporary drop in resistance was observed.  Slow voltage sweeps yielded pinched hysteresis curves and un-sulfurized control devices showed ohmic behavior before an irreversible breakdown. When the input voltage was pulsed, a large range of metastable conduction states was observed which persisted for times of ~0.1ms to several seconds.  The distribution of lifetimes followed a power law indicating possible critical dynamics. This picture pretty much sums it all up:\n",

      "Criticality is a set of universal behaviors of systems near the critical point of a second-order phase transition.  At this point, the correlation length of the system diverges and we find a scale free distribution of 'structures' in the system and an extreme sensitivity to perturbation.  A physical example is an Ising model at the critical temperature.  Under $T_c$ the system is magnetized entirely along one axis.  As it nears $T_c$, small islands with a size of order the correlation length appear magnetized in the opposite direction.  The size of these islands grows and new islands appear within them until at the critical temperature the correlation length diverges and we have a scale free distribution of island size such that no length scale is favored by the system.  At this point, if we were cooling the system, a small perturbation of a dipole can grow and select the state of the subcritical system or substantially alter the critical state. Past $T_c$ the system becomes fully disorderd, the magnetization drops to 0, and the system is no longer sensitive to small perturbations.  The critical point essentially divides a region of homogeneous order from one of homogeneous disorder."

The question then asked is, 'What is the probability that an open path exists from the top to the bottom?' This is referred to as 'bond' percolation.  In 'site' percolation, each site may be either occupied with probability $p$, or empty and the same question is asked.\n",
