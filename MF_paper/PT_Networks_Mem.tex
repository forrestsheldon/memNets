\section{INTRODUCTION}

Memristors are two terminal passive devices that display pinched hysteresis
in their I-V curve.  

The impending limits of our current computational paradigm have galvanized
interest in alternative forms of computation. Of particular interest to the
authors are attempts to address the von Neumann Bottleneck \cite{Backus1978}
whereby increases in processor speed are muted by the necessity of
shuttling data and addresses back and forth between the processor and memory.
This necessity of the von Neumann architecture suggests a solution in which
computation is performed directly in memory.  Physically coupled memory units
whose dynamics drive the system to the solution of a computational problem
would conceivably circumvent this problem (or at least translate it into the
problem of transmitting information across the system's extent) but the
realization of such an architecture is a foreboding problem.

In this however, we are buoyed by the fact that the nervous system seems to
compute in just this manner; we perceive no separate logical and memory
faculties that information is shuttled between in the brain.  Memory seems
to be stored
in the strength of synaptic coupling between neurons and by the neuronal
dynamics, the synaptic couplings are modified and computation is performed.
The desire to mimic these properties in hardware is an active field of
research in which memristors have begun to play a significant role.  
Memristor based associative memories \cite{Pershin2010, Eryilmaz2014},
 neural networks, cellular automata,
and other architectures are being explored as ways of realizing some
of the computational abilities of biological neural systems
\textit{in silico}.

In most of these, some abstracted model/element of
neural computation is adopted, such as the hopfield network or the
perceptron, and these are then linked together to form a circuit which
performs the desired function.  This design philosophy is termed 'bottom-up',
where neuromorphic circuits are engineered from the simplest components
upwards to accomplish some function.  The resulting circuits however, do not
much resemble biological neural networks in which disorder and noise are
prevalent.  A complementary approach to neuromorphic engineering is 'top-down'
design, in which systems that duplicate the gross features neural tissue
are constructed and their dynamics used to perform computation.  Reservoir
computing is an example of this philosophy in which a complex dynamical
system is used to classify inputs without detailed knowledge of the system's
structure.


Until recently, realizing systems with complex architecture
experimentally was an unmet challenge.  The advent of the memristor has
created opportunities for building electrical systems with complex, disordered
architecture and dynam

By taking advantage of a growth process, Gimzewskii et
al. CITE were able to fabricate disordered networks of memristive synapses
with a density of $10^8\; \text{synthetic synapses/cm}^2$.

The presence of disorder and robustness to noise in the brain
suggest a statistical character to the brain's function, at least at small
scales.  We put forth that one of the hopes of 'top-down' neuromorphic
engineering should be to 

The impending limits of our current computational paradigm have galvanized
interest in alternative forms of computation. As transistor densities have
increased, limits on transistor size and increased energy consumption have
spurred interest in electronic components that function reliably at small
scales and store their states passively.  Similarly, limits due to our
computational model such as the von Neumann Bottleneck have generated
interest in alternative schemes that do computation directly in memory.
CITE

Memristor based solutions have been proposed to meet both of these needs.
They are
necessarily nanoscale devices that passively maintain their resistance
state and can function both as logical and memory components.  As such,
several emerging technologies have centered around the memristor as
their core computational unit.  Among these are the crossbar array,
memristor neural networks and associative memories, memristive cellular
automata, and memcomputing.  While the conceptual and engineering
challenges to realizing new computational paradigms are great, we are
buoyed by the fact that the nervous system appears to perform computation
in just this way, with no discernable separation between memory and
logical faculties.  It would seem that memories are stored in a
distributed manner, within the synaptic connections of many neurons
and computation occurs through the generation of action potentials that
propogate through the system, modifying synaptic coupling globally.
Memristors' ability to mimic the learning properties of synapses such as
short-term and long-term memory, have further propelled their standing as
a possible hardware element for neuromorphic computing.

While most neuromorphic computing solutions have advocated a bottom-up
approach, designing fundamental units such as CMOS neurons
and linking them together in a
particular configuration to solve problems, a few have advocated a top
down approach.  In such an approach, the gross features of nervous
tissue are duplicated: a disordered, recurrent network with memory, and
the resulting system is studied to see what behaviors emerge.  As disorder
and noise play a strong role in the nervous system, we suspect a statistical
character to the dynamics and as such we investigate the statistical
dynamics of 

In order to highlight the general features of such networks, we take as
a concrete example the Atomic Switch Networks of Stieg et al. CITE.

\section{ATOMIC SWITCH NETWORKS}

In order to achieve a complex disordered network architecture, the
authors use an electroless deposition process in which solution phase
$Ag^+$ exchanges with solid $Cu$.  By seeding an area with $Cu$ 
microspheres or seed posts, the depositing $Ag$ is led to form a
densely interconnected network of wires
