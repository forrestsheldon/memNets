\maketitle

To understand the dynamics implied by the mean-field theory, we consider a single instantiation of
a network, consisting of a sample of $N$ thresholds drawn from the distribution $p(t)$. Beginning
with a fraction $f$ of these in the ON state and the self consistency equation satisfied,
\[ f = \int_0^{h(f) v} p(t) dt,\quad h(f) = \sqrt{\frac{G(f)}{\phi(f)}}\]
we raise the voltage until the next threshold is passed.  This takes $f\to f+\frac{1}{N}$, increasing 
the mean-field voltage by $\frac{h'(f)v}{N}$. The probability that $n$ memristors are switched ON
 by this increase is given by a poisson distribution
\[p_n = \frac{\mu^n}{n!} e^{-\mu}, \quad \mu = p(h(f)v) h'(f)v.\]
Each of the $n$ memristors will cause a similar increase in the mean-field voltage, and thus will give rise to the same distribution.  Thus, switching a single memristor gives rise to a Poissonian
branching process.  This may be brought into a more useful form by calculating the total number of
memristors switched in a single branching process, or the avalanche size distribution.  The
generating function $\rho(s)$ of the total number of offspring of a branching process satisfies
\[\rho(s) = sP(\rho(s))\]
where $P(s)$ is the generating function of the offspring distribution CITE FELLER, which in this case is $P(s) = e^{\mu(s-1)}$. We may obtain the series expansion of $\rho(s)$ by a Lagrange expansion,
yielding the avalanche size distribution,
\[p_S = \frac{(\mu S)^{S-1}}{S!} e^{-\mu S}, \quad S=1, 2, ...\]
with $\mu= p(h(f)v) h'(f)v$. This is a Borel distribution with mean and variance,
\[\langle S \rangle = \frac{1}{1-\mu}\quad \sigma_S^2 = \frac{\mu}{(1-\mu)^3}.\]


% If in two-column mode, this environment will change to single-column
% format so that long equations can be displayed. Use
% sparingly.

% figures should be put into the text as floats.
% Use the graphics or graphicx packages (distributed with LaTeX2e)
% and the \includegraphics macro defined in those packages.
% See the LaTeX Graphics Companion by Michel Goosens, Sebastian Rahtz,
% and Frank Mittelbach for instance.
%
% Here is an example of the general form of a figure:
% Fill in the caption in the braces of the \caption{} command. Put the label
% that you will use with \ref{} command in the braces of the \label{} command.
% Use the figure* environment if the figure should span across the
% entire page. There is no need to do explicit centering.

% \begin{figure}
% \includegraphics{}%
% \caption{\label{}}
% \end{figure}

% Surround figure environment with turnpage environment for landscape
% figure
% \begin{turnpage}
% \begin{figure}

% tables should appear as floats within the text
%
% Here is an example of the general form of a table:
% Fill in the caption in the braces of the \caption{} command. Put the label
% that you will use with \ref{} command in the braces of the \label{} command.
% Insert the column specifiers (l, r, c, d, etc.) in the empty braces of the
% \begin{tabular}{} command.
% The ruledtabular enviroment adds doubled rules to table and sets a
% reasonable default table settings.
% Use the table* environment to get a full-width table in two-column
% Add \usepackage{longtable} and the longtable (or longtable*}
% environment for nicely formatted long tables. Or use the the [H]
% placement option to break a long table (with less control than 
% in longtable).
% \begin{table}%[H] add [H] placement to break table across pages
% \caption{\label{}}
% \begin{ruledtabular}
% \begin{tabular}{}
% Lines of table here ending with \\
