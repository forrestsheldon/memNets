\begin{abstract}
Memristive elements are capable of duplicating many behaviors attributed to
organic synapses.  As such, devices that depend on the statistical properties of
disordered networks of these elements have been proposed for neuromorphic computing
and are receiving experimental attention.  However, little is known about the
dynamics of these devices in networks.  We propose a model for these devices in
the limit of a slowly ramped voltage and show through simulations that this
produces a first-order phase transition in the conductivity for sufficiently high
values of the ON/OFF ratio.  A mean-field theory that duplicates many features of
the transition is derived and examined with particular attention paid to the role
of boundary conditions and the potential for bipolar memristive switching.  The
dynamics of the mean-field theory suggest a distribution of conductance jumps which
may be accessible experimentally and finally the relevance to device design and
their ability to support computation is discussed.
